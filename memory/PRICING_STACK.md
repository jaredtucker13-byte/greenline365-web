| Tier 2: Marketing | $3,500 | $1,750 | $1,750 |
| Tier 3: Intelligence | $5,500 | $2,750 | $2,750 |

### Milestone Definition: "Technical Completion"

2. **Dashboard Handover**: Access to CRM, Marketing Hub, and Property Intelligence tools granted
3. **Directory Activation**: Client's listing is live (Ghost Badge or Active Badge logic)
4. **Logic Verification**: All workflows (Incident-to-Clearance, Poll Template Engine) verified functional

### A2P 10DLC Safeguard
- Greenline365 facilitates A2P filing within 48 hours of Technical Completion
- **Final payment is NOT tied to carrier approval** — carrier delays don't pause milestone payment
- During carrier review (7+ business days), client has full access to all non-SMS/Voice features

## TRANSACTION FEE MODEL ($0.60 per interaction)

### Core Logic
Directory-only customers pay $0.60 per trackable customer interaction. Backend service subscribers (Tier 1/2/3) have fees **waived** — they're already paying premium monthly rates.

### Fee Schedule

| Directory Action | Trigger | Directory-Only (Free/Pro/Premium) | Backend Subscriber (Tier 1/2/3) |
|---|---|---|---|
| "Call Now" click | Customer taps call button | $0.60 | $0.00 (uses AI Booking Agent) |
| "Book Now" click | Customer initiates booking | $0.60 | $0.00 (uses Cal.com integration) |
| Coupon redemption | QR scanned at POS | $0.60 | $0.00 (uses Coupon Engine) |
| Lead form submission | Customer fills contact form | $0.60 | $0.00 (routes to CRM) |
| Direction/map click | Customer gets directions | $0.60 | $0.00 (included) |

### Why It Works
- Every $0.60 represents a REAL customer interaction — not impressions, not ad clicks
- Still far cheaper than Google Ads ($5-15 per click)
- Creates natural "pain" that makes backend bundles ($1,500-$2,500/mo) look like a better deal
- Waiving fees becomes a closing incentive for upselling backend services

### The Upsell Pitch
> "You're paying $0.60 every time a customer interacts with your listing. At 500 interactions/month, that's $300. For $1,500/mo you get our full AI Booking Agent, dedicated phone line, AND all transaction fees disappear. You're basically getting the booking system for what you're already spending on fees."

### Revenue Math at Scale
- 100 directory-only businesses × 200 interactions/month × $0.60 = **$12,000/mo** in transaction fees
- Businesses that upgrade to backend tiers = $1,500-$2,500/mo recurring (fees waived)
- Net effect: transaction fees fund growth, backend subscriptions fund operations

### Three Revenue Streams from One Directory
1. **Directory Subscriptions**: $39-$59/mo per business (Pro/Premium tiers)
2. **Transaction Fees**: $0.60/interaction from directory-only users
3. **Backend Upsells**: $1,500-$2,500/mo (waives transaction fees as closing incentive)

## COUPON ENGINE (Marketplace Add-On)

### Pricing
- **$19/mo** for Coupon Engine access (infrastructure cost)
- **$0.60 per redemption** (tracked via QR scan at POS)
- Backend subscribers (Tier 1/2/3): redemption fee waived, $19/mo access included in Tier 2+

### Workflow
1. Business creates coupon: discount, expiration date, usage limit
2. Coupon auto-featured on their directory listing
3. Pushed via Campaign Manager (SMS/Email) if on Tier 2+
4. Customer scans QR at POS → logs to CRM → tracks ROI
5. $0.60 charged per redemption (directory-only) or $0.00 (backend subscriber)

### Positioning
> "You only pay $0.60 when a real customer walks through your door and scans your code. No scan, no fee."

Performance metric, not a tax.

**For Free Tier users:**
> "Your website audit shows you're losing $10k/month in missed bookings. You can buy our AI Booking Agent for $900 alone, or for just $600 more, get the full Tier 1 bundle that protects your entire reputation."

**The Audit Tripwire:**
- $400 audit pays for itself when business sees specific Missed Revenue dollar amount
- Credit $400 toward first month to close on the spot
- Upsell path: Audit → Tier 1 → Tier 2 → Tier 3

**Setup Fee Justification:**
- Shows authority: "This isn't a generic bot, it's a professionally registered business asset"
- A2P registration = federal compliance (respect the 48-hour wait)
- Covers staff labor for persona training and carrier rejections
