# GreenLine365 - Product Requirements Document

## Original Problem Statement
Build a comprehensive marketing OS for local businesses called "GreenLine365".

## What's Been Implemented

### January 2026 - Session 8 (Image Generation UX Overhaul)
- ✅ **Image Generation Workflow Refactored**: Changed from auto-generate to analyze-first approach
- ✅ **Analyze Images Button**: New "🖼️ Analyze Images" button shows suggestions without auto-generating
- ✅ **Individual Generate Buttons**: Each image suggestion has its own "Generate" button
- ✅ **Generate All Button**: Added "⚡ Generate All (N)" button with confirmation warning dialog
- ✅ **Warning Dialog**: Confirmation prompt warns user about time requirement before batch generation
- ✅ **Completion Sound**: New melodic sound notification (C-E-G-C arpeggio) plays when batch generation completes
- ✅ **Visual Status**: Generate buttons show "✓ Generated" status after image is created
- ✅ **Fixed Image Display**: Images now display correctly from URL (was broken due to URL vs base64 mismatch)
- ✅ **Mobile Vibration**: Added vibration pattern on batch completion for mobile devices

### January 2026 - Session 7 (Auto-save & Cloud Storage)
