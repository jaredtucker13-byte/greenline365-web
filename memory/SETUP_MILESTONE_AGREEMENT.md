## Property Intelligence & Reputation Ecosystem (Greenline365)

---

### 1. PROJECT SCOPE & INITIAL DEPOSIT

Upon execution of this agreement, the Client agrees to the total Setup Fee based on the selected Tier and Add-ons.

- **Initial Deposit (50%):** Due immediately to initiate environment provisioning, brand voice training, and infrastructure build-out.
- **Total Setup Value:** [Calculated based on Tier 1, 2, or 3 + Bundled Add-ons]

---

### 2. MILESTONE 1: TECHNICAL COMPLETION (Final Payment Trigger)

The final 50% of the Setup Fee is due immediately upon **Technical Completion**. Technical Completion is defined as the point when Greenline365 has finalized the following internal infrastructure:

- **AI Persona Programming:** The custom AI Agent(s) are fully trained on the Client's Knowledge Base and Brand Voice.
- **Dashboard Handover:** Access to the Greenline365 CRM, Marketing Hub, and Property Intelligence tools is granted to the Client.
- **Directory Activation:** The Client's listing is live on the Greenline365 directory (including "Ghost Badge" or Active Badge logic).
- **Logic Verification:** All internal workflows, such as the Incident-to-Clearance logic and Poll Template Engine, are verified as functional.

### 3. A2P 10DLC COMPLIANCE & CARRIER DELAYS

The Client acknowledges that federal A2P 10DLC Registration is a third-party regulatory process managed by telecommunications carriers.

- **Filing Responsibility:** Greenline365 will facilitate the filing of all necessary compliance paperwork within 48 hours of Technical Completion.
- **Payment Independence:** Because carrier review times are outside the control of Greenline365, **A2P Registration approval is NOT a condition for the Final Setup Payment.**
- **Functional Access:** During the carrier review period (estimated 7+ business days), the Client will have full access to all non-SMS/Voice features, including the Property Passport and Analytics Dashboard.

---

### 4. THE "BUNDLED URGENCY" CLAUSE

- **One-Time Discount:** All Add-ons selected during this initial setup period are billed at a 50% technical discount.
- **Future Modifications:** Any AI Agents, CRM Integrations, or technical features added after the signing of this agreement will be billed at the full, unbundled A-La-Carte Setup Rate.

### Strategic Advantage
This document acts as your safeguard. By defining "Technical Completion" as the moment your work is done, you prevent the client from holding back thousands of dollars while waiting for a carrier like Verizon or AT&T to approve an A2P application.
