<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user's primary goal is to build out GreenLine365, a comprehensive marketing OS for local businesses.

The project began with a landing page and has since expanded significantly. The current work has pivoted from a major landing page design overhaul and a paused Voice AI integration to building a new core feature requested by the user: a Blog Auto-Polish system. This system will serve as a demonstration of the product's capabilities, allowing the user to create, analyze, enhance, and publish their own blog content directly to the GreenLine365 website.

The user also provided a large amount of information regarding SEO strategy (AEO/AIO), a detailed technical specification for the blog feature, and a HIPAA compliance checklist, which have been documented.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
*   **Landing Page ():** The major design overhaul is complete. A critical CSS/GSAP bug causing invisible cards has been fixed, and all sections now render correctly with the new glassmorphism  style.

    *   **Backend:** API routes created at , , and .
    *   **Database:** A new migration file  has been created to define the necessary tables (posts, categories, tags).
    *   **Frontend:** Placeholder pages have been created for the admin editor (), the public blog listing (), and single blog posts ().
*   **Documentation:** Three key documents were created based on user input:

**Last working item**:
-   **Last item agent was working:** Building the Phase 1 MVP of the Blog Auto-Polish feature. The agent was in the middle of a large-scale build, having just created the foundational files for the database schema, backend API routes, and frontend pages. The task is substantial and the implementation of the actual logic within these files has just begun.
-   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
-   **Agent Testing Done:** N
-   **Which testing method agent to use?** both. Once the feature is built, use the backend testing agent to verify all  endpoints for creating, analyzing, scheduling, and publishing posts. Use the frontend testing agent to test the complete user flow from the editor at  to the public-facing pages at .
-   **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
-   Issue 1: Retell agent Aiden is hallucinating (P1)
-   Issue 2: Booking widget input text is invisible (P2)
-   Issue 3: General UI components are too large (P2)
-   Issue 4:  table foreign key is broken (P3)

Issues Detail:
-   **Issue 1:**
    -   Description: The Aiden sales agent in Retell AI provides incorrect information due to being created from a template.
    -   Attempted fixes: The root cause was diagnosed. The user was given instructions to create a new blank agent.
    -   Next debug checklist: The user has paused work on this. When they decide to resume, confirm they have created the new agent and are ready to test.
    -   Status: BLOCKED (User paused)
    -   Is recurring issue? Y
    -   Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix? Backend (Manual testing via Retell dashboard)
    -   Blocked on other issue: None

-   **Issue 2 - 4:**
    -   Description: These are outstanding lower-priority issues from the previous handoff that have not been addressed as the focus has shifted.
    -   Status: NOT STARTED

**In progress Task List**:
-   Task 1: Build Blog Auto-Polish feature MVP (Phase 1) (P0)

Task Detail:
-   **Task 1:**
    -   **Where to resume:** The foundational files exist, but the logic is missing. The next steps are:
        1.  Run the  migration against the Supabase DB to create the blog tables.
        2.  Implement the backend logic in the  files for CRUD operations, SEO analysis, scheduling, and publishing.
        3.  Build the frontend UI in , including a text editor, image uploader, and controls for scheduling and publishing.
        4.  Develop the public-facing blog listing page () with category/tag filters.
        5.  Develop the single post view page ().
        6.  Connect all frontend components to the backend APIs.
    -   **What will be achieved with this?** A working system that allows the user (acting as a tenant) to create, analyze, schedule, and publish blog posts to the public-facing  section of the website. This serves as a live demo of the product.
    -   **Status:** IN PROGRESS
    -   **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both
    -   **Blocked on something:** None

**Completed work in this session**
-   **Critical Bug Fix:** Resolved the landing page rendering issue where cards were invisible. This was caused by the use of a non-existent  CSS class and a GSAP  animation that set  without . All sections now render correctly.
-   **SEO Content Hub Creation:** Built and deployed a seven-page content hub to improve SEO.
    -   Created 3 feature pages ().
    -   Created 4 industry pages ().

    -   

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
-   **Enhance Photos:** A user request from a previous session to enhance all provided photos has not been actioned.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
-   The  table has a broken foreign key constraint. This is known technical debt.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, GSAP (including ScrollTrigger)
-   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
-   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
-   **Integrations:** Vercel, OpenRouter, Retell AI
-   **SEO/AEO:** Building content hubs, structured data (JSON-LD), semantic HTML, keyword integration.

**key DB schema**
-   **blog_posts:** (id, title, slug, content, author_id, status, published_at, category_id)
-   **blog_categories:** (id, name, slug)
-   **blog_tags:** (id, name, slug)
-   **blog_post_tags:** (post_id, tag_id)
(Schema defined in  but not yet applied to the database).

**changes in tech stack**
-   None.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/webapp/app/admin-v2/blog-polish/page.tsx**: The main UI for the new blog editor feature.
-   **/app/webapp/supabase/migrations/007_blog_system.sql**: The database schema for the entire blog system.
-   **/app/webapp/app/api/blog/route.ts**: The primary backend endpoint for blog post creation and listing.
-   **/app/webapp/app/blog/page.tsx**: The public-facing page that will list all blog posts.
-   **/app/webapp/app/blog/[slug]/page.tsx**: The template for displaying a single blog post.
-   **/app/webapp/app/components/Navbar.tsx**: Modified to include navigation to the new pages.
-   **/app/webapp/BLOG_AUTO_POLISH_SPEC.md**: The user's detailed specification for the feature being built.

**Areas that need refactoring**:
-   The blog feature is being built as a rapid MVP. Once functional, the API routes and frontend components should be reviewed for code quality, error handling, and separation of concerns.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Create a new blog post.
-   : Get a list of blog posts.
-   : Get a single blog post by its slug.
-   : Update a blog post.
-   : Delete a blog post.
-   : Endpoint for SEO/content analysis.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Your top priority is to continue building the Blog Auto-Polish MVP (Phase 1).** The foundational files have been created, but they are empty shells. You must implement the full logic for the database, backend, and frontend.
-   The user wants this feature to act as if they are a normal tenant, with full control over scheduling and publishing their own blogs to the live  website.
-   All AI-assisted content suggestions **must** adhere to the user's specific Jared L. Tucker brand voice: irritated but caring. Refer to the user's message for the detailed voice guide.
-   Do not work on the Retell AI issue; it is explicitly paused by the user.
-   The critical landing page rendering bug has been **FIXED**. Do not spend time investigating the landing page UI unless the user reports a new problem.
