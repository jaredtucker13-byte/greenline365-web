<analysis>**original_problem_statement:** The user wants to continue building their GreenLine365 application with several high-priority tasks. The initial goal was a general UI overhaul, but it has evolved into specific, iterative development cycles driven by detailed user feedback.

The main objectives are:
1.  **Landing Page Vision:** The user has a very specific vision for the landing page. It must tell a story about a distressed business owner, use specific imagery provided by the user, and incorporate a live demo of the Daily Trend Hunter feature. The layout must be a modular, high-density, column-based system.
2.  **About Me Page:** Create a comprehensive About Me page using a detailed biography, a personal photo of the user (Jared) with his family, and images of his past product creations (mugs, canvas art).
3.  **Content Forge Implementation:** Implement the backend for the Content Forge feature. This involves:
    *   **AI Generators:** Integrating with a specific stack of LLMs via OpenRouter (GPT-5.2, Claude Sonnet 4.5, Nano Banana Pro, Gemini 3, Perplexity) to power the Generate buttons for captions, keywords, descriptions, blogs, and hashtags. The user has provided an OpenRouter API key.
    *   **Image Upload & Persistence:** Implementing image uploads to Supabase Storage and wiring up the SCHEDULE BLAST and Save Draft buttons to persist content to the  Supabase table.
4.  **UI/UX Fixes:** Address smaller but important UI issues, such as resizing oversized components and fixing invisible text in a booking widget.

The project is a Next.js application in .

-   **Landing Page ():** The landing page has been completely overhauled to match the user's Technical Directive. It now features a modular, high-density, column-based layout with 50/50 splits and 3-column grids. It incorporates the user's storyline with all provided images and includes the live Daily Trend Hunter demo. The floating testimonial has been removed and replaced with a static version.
-   **About Page ():** A comprehensive About Me page has been created from scratch. It contains the user's biography, personal photo, and product images as requested.
-   **Content Forge Backend:** The AI generation part of the backend is complete.
    -   A new API route  has been created.
    -   This API uses the user's  (found in the environment) to connect to the specified LLMs.
    -   The frontend  component has been updated to call this real API, replacing the mock functions. All Generate buttons for text content are now functional.
-   **Build Status:** A Vercel build failure caused by an invalid  on Button components was identified. The agent applied a fix by changing the variant to  in  and .

-   **Landing page design:** This was a major point of user dissatisfaction and a recurring issue. It has been extensively addressed in this session according to very specific user directives and appears to be resolved, pending final user review.
-   ** table foreign key:** This is a known issue from a previous session and remains as technical debt.

**Code Architecture**


**Key Technical Concepts**
-   **Frontend:** Next.js (App Router), React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
-   **Backend:** Next.js API Routes
-   **Database:** Supabase (PostgreSQL)
-   **Integrations:** Vercel (Deployment), OpenRouter (for LLM access)
-   **State Management:** React Hooks (, )

**key DB schema**
-   ****: . This table exists and is the target for the next phase of Content Forge development.
-   ****: Workaround table for admin access.

**All files of reference**
-   **/app/webapp/app/page.tsx**: The landing page, now with a modular layout.
-   **/app/webapp/app/about/page.tsx**: The new About Me page.
-   **/app/webapp/app/api/content-forge/route.ts**: The new backend API for AI.
-   **/app/webapp/app/admin-v2/components/ContentForge.tsx**: The frontend for content creation, now connected to the backend.
-   **/app/webapp/components/ui/os/Button.tsx**: The button component that caused the build error.

**key api endpoints**
-   : Takes a POST request with  to generate AI content (captions, keywords, etc.) using OpenRouter.
-   : Fetches current trends for the dashboard.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
-   **Verify Build Fix First:** Your immediate first step should be to run yarn run v1.22.22
info Visit https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/run for documentation about this command. in the  directory to confirm that the  variant fix has resolved the deployment blocker.
-   **User is Very Specific:** The user provides extremely detailed feedback and technical directives. Pay close attention to their messages and reference images. They prefer extending existing content over replacing it.
-   **ContentForge is Half-Done:** The AI text generation for ContentForge is live and working via the user's OpenRouter key ( is in the environment). The next critical step is implementing image uploads and saving the content to the  table in Supabase.
-   **Database is Ready:** The user has confirmed they ran the SQL migration, so the  table is ready to be used. You do not need to ask them to run it again.
