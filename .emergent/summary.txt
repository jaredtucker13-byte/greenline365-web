<analysis>**original_problem_statement:**
The user wants to set up a continuous deployment pipeline from their GitHub repository to Vercel. Specifically, they want to make a new  page public. Currently, pushes to the  branch are not triggering successful deployments of the latest code, and the user is stuck with an old, outdated version of the site being live. The user is frustrated, concerned about costs, and believes there may be an issue with Vercel itself.

**User's preferred language**: English

**what currently exists?**
The project is a Next.js application located within a  subdirectory in the git repository. The GitHub repository is connected to a Vercel project. A Vercel Deploy Hook has been created and configured as a webhook in GitHub as a workaround for the failing native Git integration. The code for the  page exists and has been successfully force-pushed to the  branch on GitHub. The Vercel project's  setting has been correctly updated to , but deployments are still failing.

**Last working item**:
- **Last item agent was working:** The agent and user were debugging why Vercel deployments were failing. After confirming the code was on  and the project settings were correct, the user clicked the Details link on a failed build check in GitHub. This led to the Vercel deployment logs, which the user screenshotted and sent. The agent has not yet analyzed these logs to identify the specific build error.
- **Status:** IN PROGRESS
- **Agent Testing Done:** N
- **Which testing method agent to use?** Manual analysis of the build logs provided by the user is the immediate next step. After a fix is implemented, the agent should trigger a deployment and manually verify the  URL.
- **User Testing Done:** N

**All Pending/In progress Issue list**:
- **Issue 1: Vercel deployment fails on push to  branch (P0)**
  - **Description:** Despite the GitHub repository being connected and a deploy hook being in place, all attempts by Vercel to build the latest commit from the  branch are failing. This prevents any new code, including the  page, from going live.
  - **Attempted fixes:**
    - A Vercel Deploy Hook and corresponding GitHub webhook were created. This confirmed Vercel was receiving triggers, but the builds still failed.
    - The latest code was successfully force-pushed to the  branch to resolve a conflict.
    - The Vercel project's  setting was corrected to .
    - A Redeploy was attempted with the new settings, but this reused the old source code and did not solve the problem.
  - **Next debug checklist:**
    1.  **Analyze the Vercel build logs** provided in the screenshots from Chat Message 102. This is the most critical step as it contains the specific error message causing the build to fail.
    2.  Based on the error found in the logs, identify the root cause (e.g., a dependency issue, a syntax error, a configuration problem in , etc.).
    3.  Implement the necessary code or configuration fix.
    4.  Push the fix to the  branch to trigger a new Vercel deployment.
    5.  Monitor the deployment on Vercel to ensure it completes successfully.
    6.  Verify the fix by accessing the  page on the production URL.
  - **Why fix this issue and what will be achieved with the fix?** Fixing this will establish a working CI/CD pipeline, allowing the user to deploy new features and fixes. It will specifically make the  page and other recent changes publicly accessible.
  - **Status:** IN PROGRESS
  - **Is recurring issue?** Y (This has been the central problem of the entire session).
  - **Should Test frontend/backend/both after fix?** Both. The backend (deployment process) must be confirmed to work, and the frontend ( page) must be visually checked to ensure it loads correctly.
  - **Blocked on other issue:** None.

**In progress Task List**:
There are no other tasks in progress. The entire focus is on resolving the deployment issue.

**Upcoming and Future Tasks**
- **Upcoming Tasks:**
  - Once the deployment issue is resolved, the user has expressed interest in working on the **Campaign Dashboard**. (P1)
  - The user also mentioned possibly **removing the pricing page**. (P2)

**Completed work in this session**
- Set up a Vercel Deploy Hook and configured it as a GitHub webhook.
- Resolved a Git conflict by force-pushing the local codebase to the  branch on GitHub.
- Correctly configured the Vercel project's **Root Directory** setting to point to the  folder.

**Earlier issues found/mentioned but not fixed**
None. The main issue has been the sole focus and is not yet fixed.

**Known issue recurrence from previous fork**
N/A

**Code Architecture**
The project follows a monorepo-like structure where the main Next.js application is not at the root level but is nested inside a  directory.


**Key Technical Concepts**
- **Framework:** Next.js
- **Hosting/Deployment:** Vercel
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
- **CI/CD:** Vercel's native Git integration and Deploy Hooks.
- **Debugging:** Analyzing build logs, checking project configuration settings, and verifying Git state.

**key DB schema**
N/A

**changes in tech stack**
N/A

**All files of reference**
- : The primary new feature file that the user wants to see deployed.
- : A potential location for build configuration issues.
- : A potential location for dependency-related build issues.

**Critical Info for New Agent**
- The user is frustrated and concerned about burning money (even on a hobby plan, this reflects their frustration level). Be direct, confident, and focus on the immediate problem.
- **DO NOT** revisit already completed debugging steps (checking the Root Directory, creating another webhook, etc.).
- **Your IMMEDIATE FIRST ACTION must be to analyze the build logs from the screenshots in Chat Message 102.** The user has provided the smoking gun evidence; they are waiting for an analysis of it. The conversation ended with the user asking for feedback on those screens (Chat Message 105).
- The problem is almost certainly a build error (e.g., dependency, code error), not an infrastructure connection issue between GitHub and Vercel.

**documents and test reports created in this job**
None.

**Last 10 User Messages and any pending HUMAN messages**
1.  **User (pending):** What are you waiting for? You didnt give me any actions or any feedback from those screens." - User is waiting for analysis of the build logs.
2.  **User (provided info):** Sent screenshots of the failed build details on Vercel, which contain the build logs.
3.  **User (reported outcome):** Stated "I still dont think it worked after the redeploy and provided a screenshot.
4.  **User (provided info):** Sent a screenshot of the Redeploy dialog, asking whether to check the box.
5.  **User (provided info):** Sent screenshots showing the  is now set to  and a warning about configuration differences.
6.  **User (provided info):** Sent screenshots of the General settings page after being told (incorrectly) to look for the Root Directory there.
7.  **User (provided info):** Confirmed the force push worked by sending a screenshot from GitHub showing the latest commits with a failed check.
8.  **User (reported outcome):** Stated the website is still not building correctly and expressed concern about burning credits. Complained Vercel's website was freezing.
9.  **User (reported outcome):** Confirmed the force push was done.
10. **User (made decision):** Confirmed there were no changes on GitHub to keep and chose to Force Push anyway.

**Project Health Check:**
- **Broken:** The entire CI/CD pipeline is non-functional. Pushes to  result in failed Vercel builds.

**3rd Party Integrations**
- **Vercel:** Used for hosting and deployment.
- **GitHub:** Used for source code management.

**Testing status**
- **Testing agent used after significant changes:** NO
- **Troubleshoot agent used after agent stuck in loop:** NO
- **Test files created:** None
- **Known regressions:** The deployment pipeline is entirely broken.

**Credentials to test flow:**
N/A

**What agent forgot to execute**
The previous agent failed to analyze and respond to the final, critical piece of information provided by the user: the screenshots of the Vercel build logs in Chat Message 102. The session ended with the user explicitly asking for a response to this information.</analysis>
