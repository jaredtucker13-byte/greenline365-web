# Greenline365 - Website Content & Branding Guide

## The Branding Pivot
We are officially moving away from "AI Receptionist" or "Booking Bot."

**New Master Term:** Property Intelligence Engine

**The Goal:** Every page must emphasize that we anchor data to the Physical Address (Property-First) and utilize Predictive Logic (Weather/Asset Decay).

## About Us Section

### Headline
**We Built the Brain Your Business Was Missing.**

### The Story
At Greenline365, we didn't set out to build another "chatbot." We spent years in the home service trenches, watching high-ticket jobs vanish because a phone wasn't answered at 9 PM or a customer's history was buried in a messy spreadsheet.

We realized that for a service business, the most valuable asset isn't just the phone call—it's the **Property**.

Greenline365 was born to bridge that gap. We created a **Property Intelligence Engine** that doesn't just book appointments—it *remembers*. It recognizes the specific unit in a customer's home, calculates their relationship value, and watches the local weather to predict their needs before they even call.

We are a small, elite team dedicated to turning local contractors into "Superhuman" service providers. With Greenline365, you aren't just "open 24/7"—you're the smartest company in the room.
