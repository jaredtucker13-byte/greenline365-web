# Greenline365 - Terms of Service Addendum
## Critical Legal Clauses for AI & Telecommunications Compliance

**Jurisdiction:** State of Florida, USA
**Last Updated:** February 2026

---

## 1. A2P (Application-to-Person) Compliance Clause

### 1.1 Client Responsibility for Registration Data
The Client acknowledges and agrees that they are solely responsible for providing accurate, complete, and truthful information during the A2P 10DLC registration process, including but not limited to:
- Employer Identification Number (EIN)
- Legal business name and DBA
- Business address and contact information
- Brand registration details
- Use case descriptions

### 1.2 Consequences of Inaccurate Information
If Greenline365's telecommunications services (including but not limited to SMS messaging capabilities) are suspended, restricted, or terminated by any carrier, aggregator, or regulatory body due to inaccurate, incomplete, or fraudulent information provided by the Client, Greenline365 reserves the right to:
- Immediately suspend the Client's access to all Services without prior notice
- Terminate the Service Agreement without refund of any fees paid
- Pursue recovery of any fines, penalties, or damages incurred

### 1.3 Carrier Approval Timeline
The Client acknowledges that carrier approval for A2P messaging may take up to 10 business days or longer. Payment milestones are tied to "Technical Activation" (defined as voice services going live AND A2P registration being submitted), NOT carrier approval completion.

## 2. Florida Two-Party Consent Mandate

### 2.1 Recording Disclosure Requirement
The Client acknowledges that the State of Florida requires all-party consent for call recording (Florida Statute § 934.03). As such, the following provisions are mandatory and non-negotiable:

### 2.2 Mandatory Disclosure Script
All calls handled by the Greenline365 Property Intelligence Engine must include a recording disclosure statement at the beginning of each call. This disclosure is hardcoded into the system and CANNOT be disabled, modified, or bypassed by the Client.

**Standard Disclosure Language:**
> "Just so you know, my human creators make me record this call for quality and training—and to make sure I don't miss a single detail of your project. Now, how can I help you today?"

### 2.3 Client Waiver Prohibited
The Client may NOT request, instruct, or attempt to circumvent the recording disclosure requirement. Any such request will be denied, and repeated attempts may result in service termination.

### 2.4 Liability Shield
Greenline365 shall not be held liable for any legal claims arising from call recordings where the mandatory disclosure was properly delivered by the system. The Client assumes all responsibility for ensuring their use of recorded calls complies with applicable laws.

## 3. AI Reliability Disclaimer

### 3.1 Nature of AI Services
The Client acknowledges that the Greenline365 Property Intelligence Engine utilizes artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies. While these systems are designed to be highly accurate and reliable, they are supportive tools that may occasionally:
- Provide information that requires human verification
- Misinterpret verbal communications
- Make errors in data transcription or measurement conversion

### 3.2 Measurement Accuracy Example
The AI system processes and records measurements as communicated by callers (e.g., "a 10-inch pipe" or "a 4-ton unit"). The Client acknowledges that:
- Verbal measurements may be misheard or mistranscribed
- Technical specifications should be verified by qualified personnel before ordering parts or materials
- Greenline365 is not responsible for errors resulting from unverified AI-transcribed specifications

### 3.3 Human Verification Requirement
The Client agrees that all technical specifications, measurements, and critical information captured by the AI system should be verified by qualified human personnel before being acted upon. The AI serves as a data capture and scheduling tool, not a replacement for professional technical judgment.

### 3.4 Limitation of Liability
Greenline365 shall not be liable for any damages, costs, or losses arising from:
- Incorrect parts ordered based on AI-transcribed measurements
- Scheduling conflicts due to AI interpretation errors
- Technical recommendations made by the AI system
- Any decision made by the Client or their customers based solely on AI-provided information
